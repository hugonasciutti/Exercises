// In this example below the file read was:
// file.txt
27.5 Uberl√¢ndia SE
17.5 Araguari SE
0.5 Uberaba SE

FILE *f = fopen("file.txt", "r");
float myFloat;

// The pointer f is at position 0

while (fscanf(f, "%f", &myFloat) != EOF) {
  // When it gets it's first value the pointer will walk by it's own, you don't need to worry about moving the pointer;
  // The pointer got the float value of 27.5 and now is at position 5
}
